Hi, I'm [Baolu Yu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baoluyu//), a student Major in Information Science in UW-Madison. 

I always feel a great sense of accomplishment when I am able to integrate resources and create platforms. My motivation for learning data analysis was to improve the performance of my family's business, and to achieve this, I have learned skills in database management and design, data cleansing and analysis, machine learning with a focus on NLP, and various tools for data visualization. I also became deeply interested in software and website development, because the process of designing behavior and thought allows for creativity, and products can be implemented according to my own ideas and concepts. The results of this implementation then create my channels for communication and exchange. Although I am still in the process of exploration, I am very clear that I will continue on this path.

I believe that the pursuit of knowledge and self-improvement is a lifelong journey that brings joy and enrichment to my life. Whether it's learning a new tech skill, exploring a new project, or finding ways to grow and develop as a person, I am constantly seeking out opportunities to learn and grow. I believe that this mindset has helped me to become a more well-rounded and fulfilled individual, and I hope to continue this journey of self-discovery and improvement for many years to come.

## Experience:
I have previously worked in the investment banking and sales industries for two years, and later worked as a data analyst for an e-commerce company for one year. Currently, I am a TA for a database course at UW-Madison and have also interned for DOIT.
